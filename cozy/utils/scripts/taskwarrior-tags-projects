# The goal of this script is to reduce the number of async calls required
# in Awesome to get data from Taskwarrior. It gets all active tags and all
# active projects for those tags at once. It returns them in this format,
# which is easily parsable within Awesome:

# Cozy    # <- The first line is the tag name
# Agenda  # <- The rest of the lines are all the projects in this tag
# General
# Ledger
# Misc apps
# Other configs
# Support
# Tasks
# Timewarrior
# UI
# -----   # <- This separates the tags
# Applications
# (none)  # <- This shows when there's a task with this tag, but no set project
# Have not applied
# Prep
# Rejected
# Waiting for reply
# -----

# Get all tags in a string, with each tag separated by newline
tags="$(task tag 2> /dev/null | tail -n +4 | head -n -2 | awk 'NF--')"

# Put tags into tags_array
IFS='\r\n' readarray -t tags_array <<< $tags

# For each tag, print the tag name, then print all projects in the tag
for tag in "${tags_array[@]}"
do
  echo $tag
  task tag:$tag projects 2> /dev/null | tail -n +4 | head -n -2 | awk 'NF--'
  echo "====="
done
